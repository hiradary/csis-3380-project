Project Proposal:

The project is about a News Analysis tool that leverages Large Language Models (e.g., GPT-4)
to perform some analysis on a given news.

It asks for a URL from a designated list of news sources to analyze the news text. Alternatively,
one can copy and paste the text from whatever news source. The URL input merely serves
as a tool to improve the UX.

The analysis includes generating highlights, semantic checks, open questions, etc. The user will also be able to chat with the AI and get its viewpoint on a specific aspect of the text.
